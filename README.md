# Microservices README

## Introduction
This repository contains a set of microservices built using Spring Boot, which are designed to work together to provide a complete e-commerce system. The system consists of the following microservices:

- Product Service: Manages product information.
- Inventory Service: Tracks product inventory.
- Order Service: Handles order processing.
- Discovery Service: Provides service discovery and registry.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Maven

## Prerequisites
Before running these microservices, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven

## Getting Started
To get started with the microservices, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the root directory of each microservice.
3. Build the microservice using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run each microservice individually using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar target/microservice.jar
   ```
   Replace `microservice.jar` with the actual JAR file generated in the `target` directory.

5. Once all the microservices are up and running, you can access the services through their respective endpoints.
